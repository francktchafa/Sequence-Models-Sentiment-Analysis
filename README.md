This repository contains two notebooks that explore sentiment analysis and emotion representation through natural language processing.

**Project_Sentiment_Analysis_v1.ipynb: Emojifier with Word Vectors**
Leverages pre-trained word vector representations to create an Emojifier that maps sentences to their most relevant emoji. Examples include:
* "Job well done!" → 👍
* "Let's get coffee and talk." → ☕️
* "I love you!" → ❤️

**Project_Sentiment_Analysis_v2.ipynb: Enhanced Emojifier with LSTM**
Builds on the first model by integrating an LSTM-based architecture for capturing sequential dependencies in text. This approach enhances the model's ability to associate emojis with context-rich sentences.
